# Spencer Livingston

An absolutely wonderful Cyber Security professional, passionate about everything InfoSec and Ethical Hacking!

I began my intimate (cough) relationship with computers before my legs could carry me upright. My father was a Software Architect who always had several computers lying around given to him by the company. It's said that as soon as my father plopped a computer on the floor in front of me, I'd simply screech whenever they tried to move me away...nothing's changed..maybe the pitch of the screech?

## Experience

I got my start at Barracuda Networks as a Support Intern. I moved on shortly after to a Lead Support Tech position for a while then left for an IT Internship. At that company, I was hired on full time and given the "I.T. Assistant" title...(not assistant to the I.T. Manager! Okay..maybe a little). From there, I began working at an MSP as a Level II tech. Slowly, I took the reigns on every single Security task available to me. Seriously. I even started penetration testing for new client onboardings, doing security risk assessments and more. Similarly, in my IT Assistant position I fully revamped their Information Security policies, structure, incident response and hardened their web-application security. Yes, I was severely underpaid..but the experience was invaluable.
Security is simply too much fun for me. Nothing ignites me like security does. Sometimes, I'll be researching..performing a penetration test or studying and find myself plastered with a smile..eyes wide open. **That** is why I love this sh-
Now, I'm a level III Systems Engineer, relatively under-utilized in my position and looking for my transition into a security-focused role where I can really flex my skills and contribute to an awesome team!
